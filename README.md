# Stacks

Array has all the function of the stack.

functions
    1. push

# Sets

Set Data Structure is kind of like an array there are no duplicate values and not in any perticular order. used to check an presense of an item. ES6 is an in-built set object. However, built in set object doesn't contain all the methods that are common to sets so you may still have to implement part of the set yourself.

# Queue

The queue data structure is a way to hold data, it's similar to a stack while a stack is first in last out where a queue is first in first out.

# Priority Queue

Priority queue in a priority queue  not only do you pass the element into the queue youa also pass the priority of the element so if all the priorities are the same element but whwn you pass in elements at different priorities the elements that sre passed in with the a higher priority are sent to the begining of the queue.

# Binary Search Tree

A tree data structure is a way to hold data that when visuaized looks like a tree you would see in nature now.

    Root/Parent
    Left Child/ Right Child
    Siblings
    Leaf
    Right SubTree
    Left SubTree
